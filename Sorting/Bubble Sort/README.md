## Bubble Sort ##

It sorts the elements by repeatedly moving the largest element to the highest index position (in case of ascending order) 
or moves the smallest element to the highest index position (in case of descending order). 
It is called "Bubble sort" because the largest or smallest elements "bubble up" to the top of the list in each pass.
